# UniBuddy

This application brings the resources and study materials from different universities and portals under one roof, with free and open access to everyone.

UniBuddy is an app that encourages open study resources for all. Our ultimate aim is to create a library through which the students can access the study materials and other university specific resources. Currently we are using Firebase API in this initial build but we plan to host it ourselves in the future.
